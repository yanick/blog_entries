# Pushing Your Code TODOs to GitHub Issues

A quick one. Wouldn't it be cool to be able to scan your code for all *TODO*s
and *FIXME*s and generate GitHub issues out of them? Well, I thought so too,
so:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl 

use 5.16.0;

use strict;
use warnings;

use Path::Iterator::Rule;
use Path::Tiny;
use List::AllUtils qw/ indexes before apply first /;
use Git::Repository;
use IO::Prompt::Tiny qw/prompt/;
use Net::GitHub;

my $git = Git::Repository->new( work_tree => '.' );

# my remote is always named 'github', you might have to 
# adapt to your habits
my( $project ) = first { /^github/ } $git->run( 'remote', '-v' );
$project =~ s/^.*?://;
$project =~ s/\.git.*$//;

my $github = Net::GitHub->new(
    login => 'you', 
    pass => 'yourpassword',
);

$github->set_default_user_repo( split '/', $project );

Path::Iterator::Rule->new
    ->file
    ->name( qr/\.p[lm]$/ )
        # I'm too lazy for the next() dance...
    ->and( sub{ 
        my $path = path($_);

        my @lines = $path->lines;
        process_todo( $path, $_, \@lines ) for indexes { 
            /^ \s* \# \s* (?:TODO|FIXME) /x and not /\[GH\d+\]/ 
        } @lines;

        return 0; # we don't want to collect the files
    })
    ->all( @ARGV );

sub process_todo {
    my( $file, $nbr ) = @_;
    my @lines = @{$_[2]};

    my $subject = $lines[$nbr] =~ s/^.*?#\s*(?:TODO|FIXME)\s*//r;
    my @body = apply { s/^\s*#\s?// } before { !/^\s*#/ }  @lines[$nbr+1..$#lines];

    # TODO don't assume master
    my $url = "https://github.com/$project/blob/master/$file#L$nbr";
    $url .= '-' . ($nbr+@body) if @body;

    say $subject;
    say "";
    say @body;

    prompt( "create Issue? (y/N)", 'n' ) =~ /y/ or return;

    my $isu = $github->issue->create_issue( {
        "title" => $subject,
        "body" => join( '', @body, "\n\n", $url ),
        labels => [ 'code todo' ],
    } ) or die "error in creating issue";

    say "issue ", $isu->{number}, " created";
    say $isu->{html_url};
    say "";

    my $issue = $isu->{number};

    $lines[$nbr] =~ s/(TODO|FIXME)/$1 [GH$issue]/;

    $file->spew(@lines);
}
```


And with that little beauty, you can do

```bash
$ todo2gh.pl lib
```

in the root of your project and it'll sniff all the modules and scripts and,
for all TODO found of the format

```perl
# TODO frobusnicate the loop
# some details that will end up in the issue's body
```

it'll prompt you if you want to create an issue and automagically convert
the TODO to

```perl
# TODO [GH3] frobusnicate the loop
# some details that will end up in the issue's body
```

Meanwhile, a new issue will now live on GitHub, with the proper title and
label, and a nice link in the body leading to that exact place in the code.

Enjoy!

(And if you are interested to improve on the script, it lives
for the time being [in my env
repo](https://github.com/yanick/environment/blob/master/bin/todo2gh.pl))
