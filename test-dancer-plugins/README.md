# Mass-Testing Dancer's Plugins

One of my highlights of [YAPC::EU 2012](http://act.yapc.eu/ye2012/) was to meet a few of the core 
Dancer dudes (and, yes, a blog entry about the conference is forthcoming, it
only has been delayed by two weeks of utterly decadent vacations in the heart
of the Rhine Valley). Amongst other things, dams filled me in on the progress
of Dancer 2, and what tasks still lay ahead before this rewrite of our
favorite micro-web framework can hit the streets. One of the items on the
to-do list is to verify that most of the plugins already written for Dancer 1
will still work for Dancer 2. *Well*, I thought, *that's just like doing [smoke
testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing#Smoke_testing_in_software_development) 
for a small subset of Perl modules. How hard can it be?*

Yeah, I do tend to say silly things like that...

## Corraling the Modules

First task: gather the modules to test. Finding all of Dancer's plugins is
relatively simple. Mostly if your cpan client is configured to use the SQLite
backend:

```bash
$ sqlite3 ~/.cpan/cpandb.sql 'select dist_name from dists \
    where dist_name like "Dancer-Plugin%"' \
    | perl -pe's/-/::/g' > plugins
```

If the output of that command is to be trusted, there are 76 Dancer plugins
out there. Not a bad number. For keeping them around, I decided to have a go at [Pinto](cpan), which
turned out to be a joy.

```bash
perl -ne'chomp; next if /^\s*#/; `pinto -v pull $_`' plugins
```

Mind you, the command could have been as simple as

```bash
pinto -v pull < plugins
```

but for two things: I wanted to be able to comment out problematic plugins in
the list and skip over them, and it seems that Pinto would abort commiting all
of the pulled distributions if one of them goes wrong. And while pulling 76 distros
and all their dependencies **did** generate a lot of wrongness, so calling
pinto on each plugin independently was the fastest way out.

## Testing the Herd

With all the modules nicely accessing, I thought I had it done. 

AH! 

It turns
out that while Perl has an awesome ecosystem for testing, it's also quite
befuddling at first, and most of the modules are almost but not quite what I
was wanting. To wit: they are mostly aimed at smoking ALL THE THINGS on
potentially many perls, and push the results to a smoking mothership rather
than feed a local database.  A specific module,
[SmokeRunner::Multi](cpan), seemed more promising for the task, and could
even talk to a [Smolder](cpan) instance. ... well, to make a long story
short, at the end I didn't use it (although I still keep it on the wing), but
I ended up becoming its maintainer. Just don't ask me how that happened.

What I ended up doing, instead, is leverage the `--test-only` option of
`cpanm`. I haven't found a way yet to use it in such a way that I would get
the full TAP results for a distro (although I'm sure there's a way),
but it reports the overall success or failure, which is already a start.

So, I have a way to test the modules. Now, I need to store the results. How
about going easy and sleazy and using that `DBIx::NoSQL::Store::Manager` I
[hacked a few months
back](http://babyl.dyndns.org/techblog/entry/shaving-the-white-whale)?
(No, it's not on CPAN yet. Yes, I'm going to do something about that Real
Soon<sup>tm</sup>) 

`` DancerTest.pm ``

`` Types.pm ``

`` Plugin.pm ``

And with that in hand, we just need one more script to turn in the crank:

`` test_one.pl ``

Aaaand:

```bash
$ ./test_plugins.pl plugins 
testing Dancer::Plugin::ExtDirect
\ {
    __CLASS__      "DancerTest::Model::Plugin",
    dancer1_pass   1,
    dancer2_pass   1,
    name           "Dancer::Plugin::ExtDirect",
    timestamp      "2012-09-18T01:41:52",
    verbose        1,
    version        1.03
}
testing Dancer::Plugin::TTHelpers
\ {
    __CLASS__      "DancerTest::Model::Plugin",
    dancer1_pass   1,
    dancer2_pass   1,
    name           "Dancer::Plugin::TTHelpers",
    timestamp      "2012-09-18T01:42:01",
    verbose        1,
    version        0.004
}
```


Final stroke, reporting the latest results:

`` reporting.pl ``

Which gives us:

```bash
$ ./report.pl

According to the report, 37 plugins
pass their test under Dancer 1, but not Dancer2. Now we know exactly what work
remains to do. So... Let's get crackin'.
