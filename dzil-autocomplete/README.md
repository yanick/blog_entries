# Dist::Zilla autocomplete

Does anyone know of a *Yak Shaving Anonymous*
association  hackers addicted to Tibetan bovine shearing could join?

Anyway, here are two little things I hacked on top of Dist::Zilla
that peeps might find useful.

[The first](http://github.com/yanick/dist-zilla/tree/autocomplete), as hinted by the blog entry's title, is a direct adaptation
of [Aristotle's perldoc-complete](http://github.com/ap/perldoc-complete) for
dzil.  

```
$ dzil *<tab>* 
build     install   new       plugins   rjbsver   smoke     xtest     
clean     listdeps  nop       release   run       test      
```


[The second](http://github.com/yanick/dist-zilla/tree/command-plugins) 
is actually the one that started that round of shaving for me.  As
there is about a gazillion Dist::Zilla plugins, I wanted to have a quick way 
to see all the plugins installed on a specific machine.
Enter a new dzil sub-command: `plugins`.  

```
$ dzil plugins
[ lotsa plugins ]
MatchManifest - Ensure that MANIFEST is correct
MetaConfig - summarize Dist::Zilla configuration into distmeta
MetaJSON - produce a META.json
* MetaNoIndex - Stop CPAN from indexing stuff
MetaProvides - Generating and Populating 'provides' in your META.yml
MetaProvides::Class - Scans Dist::Zilla's .pm files and tries to identify classes using Class::Discover.
MetaProvides::FromFile - In the event nothing else works, pull in hand-crafted metadata from a specified file.
MetaProvides::Package - Extract namespaces/version from traditional packages for provides
* MetaResources - provide arbitrary "resources" for distribution metadata
MetaTests - common extra tests for META.yml
MetaYAML - produce a META.yml
[ still lotsa plugins ]
```

The plugins marked with an asterix are used by the current `dist.ini`.  Also,
give a plugin name to the sub-command, and it'll act as a glorified 
`perldoc Dist::Zilla::Plugin::*Plugin Name*`.  The sweet thing is,
autocomplete also work there:

```
$ dzil plugins Pod<Tab>
PodCoverageTests  PodSyntaxTests    PodVersion        PodWeaver
```

Both patches are available on [my Github fork of
Dist::Zilla](http://github.com/yanick/dist-zilla). Enjoy!
