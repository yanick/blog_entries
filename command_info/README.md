# A small Ansible module: `command_info`

TL;DR: look ma, I'm writing Python! 

As documented in [an earlier blog entry](/entry/ansible-dream), I 
try to capture the configuration of my environment via Ansible playbooks and
roles. Admittedly overkill, but I have to remain true to my brand.

In those configuration playbooks relating to command-line tools, there is a recurring pattern:
is the tool already installed and at its desired version (or better)? Yes?
Good. No? Then do the install dance. 

The biggest bit of that pattern is retrieving the information as of the
local existence of that command and of its version. Which is not too bad to
retrieve, but not exactly a beauty either:

```yaml
- name: check for installed thingy
  shell: "thingy --version 2>&1 | perl -nE'say $1 if /v(\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+)/'"
  register: installed_thingy
  ignore_errors: true

- name: install new thingy
  when: "installed_thingy.stdout != thingy_version"
  import_tasks: ./install.yml
```

Wouldn't it be better to have that munging be made more generic and hidden
behind a custom module? I'm thinking something like:

```yaml
- name: check for installed thingy
  command_info: 
    command_name: thingy
    target_version: '{{thingy_version}}'
  register: installed_thingy

- name: install new thingy
  when: installed_thingy.needs_upgrade
  import_tasks: ./install.yml
```

Yes? Well, I thought so too. And since Ansible is kind enough to allow writing
modules in any language, I did a [first version of that module in Perl](https://github.com/yanick/dev-env/blob/main/playbooks/library/command_facts):

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl

# WANT_JSON
use strict;
no warnings;

use JSON qw/ to_json from_json /;

open my $fh, '<', shift;

my $config = from_json join '', <$fh>;

my $program = $config->{program};
my $args = $config->{version_args};

my %facts = (
    target_version => $config->{target_version}
);

chomp( $facts{location} = `which $program` );

sub numify {
    my $num = 0;

    $num = $num * 1_000 + $_ for $_[0] =~ /(\d+)/g;

    return $num;
}

if( $facts{location} ) {
    ($facts{version}) = `$program $args`;
    chomp $facts{version};
    $facts{version} =~ /([0-9.]+)/;
    $facts{version} = $1 if $1;
    $facts{num_version} = numify($facts{version});
}

$facts{num_version} ||= 0;

$facts{changed} = $facts{version} eq $config->{target_version}
                  ? JSON::false
                  : JSON::true;

$facts{needs_upgrade} = $facts{num_version} 
                            < numify($config->{target_version}) 
                        ? JSON::true 
                        : JSON::false;

print to_json \%facts;
```

And that already works pretty darn swell. But today I was looking at it, and
thought it'd be nice to document that module. 

Alas, it seems that documenting
modules in a way that `ansible-doc` can understand can only be done for Python
code. I... could have tried to fudge my Perl code in a way that it'd look
Pythonish enough for `ansible-doc` and yet still be executable Perl, but eeeeeh,
why not using this as an excuse to try my hand at real, honest to God Python
code? And thus the Perl script became [this](https://github.com/yanick/dev-env/blob/main/plugins/modules/command_info.py):
