#aotds, captain log 4: navigation orders hooked into the ship's course. We're gaining control of our ship!

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
    <video class="u-video" src="./update.mp4" width="800" controls>
        <source src="./update.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
</div>

**update**: I've been notified that the way that ship course extends upward and then flop into in a sad downward curve is hilarious.  You peeps have terrible, terrible, twisted minds.
