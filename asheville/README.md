# Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it's down to Asheville we go

Thanks to [Pythian][pythian]'s philosophy of keeping their employees on the bleeding
edge of technology, at the end of this month I'll be crossing the American
borders for the first time in many years and will land in Asheville, North
Carolina to join the [YAPC::NA][yapc] festivities.  It's been ages since I
attended a major conference (the last time was, *oh gawd*,
the [Opnet][opnet] conference of 2002?), and this will be my first YAPC ever.
Am I thrilled? Ooooh heck yeah, I sure am.

Last week, I looked at the list of talks and went through the difficult
process of dividing them into two groups: talks that I want to see, and
talks that I really, *really*, want to see.  With that painful exercise done,
here is what my own personal schedule tentatively looks like:

## Monday, June 27th

* 10:00 - [Welcome and Keynote Address][A]

Because going to YAPC without attending a Larry Wall keynote is like going to
Disneyworld and not have your picture taken with Mickey.

* 11:35 - [Lighting Talks][B]

Another must-attend of any YAPC. Fast and furious machine-gun-quick talks, the
way we like it.

* 13:55 - [Perl Programming Best Practices 2011][C]

I've always been a big fan of Damian Conway's [Perl Best Practices][dog]. It's
still a wonderful tome of wisdom but, of course, some things change. The
popularity of the inside out OO systems waned, and Moose took the Perl world
by storm. Some modules, very promising at the time, slowly sank in the tar pit
of stagnation.  To have an update of what is deemed to be best of breed
and best of creed in 2011 can be nothing but refreshing.

* 14:55 - [How NOT to build a multi-million dollar eCommerce system][D]

In which gphat, bless his heart, will altruistically share all the mistakes he made during
his eCommerce adventures, so that we, strong of his experience,
sidestep them all and jump straight to the more involved and subtle ones.

* 16:15 - [Telecommuting, or how to survive work without a water cooler][E]

Although I do have a water cooler, and I don't currently telecommute, this is
such an integral part of the ronin hacker's way of life that it could hardly
be missed.

* 17:15 - [The business aware programmer][F]

Simply because l33t coding is only half the battle.

## Tuesday, June 28th

* 10:00 - [Postmodern Module Packaging][G]

To get a distribution from here to there is often
more hairy than to write the darn said distribution in the first place.
Hopefully, this talk will show us how bright, shiny and unicorn-paved
the future is for us who need to lob around modules like crazed tennis-ball
machines.

* 11:00 - [POE/Reflex vs Coro/AnyEvent][H]

Event-based programmation is something that I only touched a
few times. Still, this is something that, sooner or later, we
all need to whip out of our toolbox.

* 14:20 - [The Game Crafter, a Perl Success Story][I]

Perl success story. About a website. Inspiration.

* 14:50 - [DBIx::Class::Shadow][J]

Because is B5 is not there anymore, DBIx::Class is our last
best chance for sane database interaction.

* 15:40 - [A Million-Player Game Server in Event-Driven Perl][K]

That should throw some wicked lights on how well Perl can scale to
massive loads.

* 17:30 - [Lightning Talks][L]

Probably going to be even faster and furiouser than the ones of the day before.

## Wednesday, June 29th

* 10:00 - [Shipwright: Application Distribution Simplified][M]

Heard about it, never had the opportunity to play with it. Golden
opportunity to see what this baby has to offer.

* 11:00 - [Jackalope][N]

Because if Stevan Little is its daddy and it sports antlers, it's
bound to be awesome.

* 13:50 - [Testing with PSGI][O]

Testing is good. PSGI on the rise. Learning how to
test with PSGI? Probably a very good idea.

* 14:20 - [Intro to Dancer][P]

I'm all jitter-buggy and can't wait to see that talk about that Dancer thing everybody
rave about. ;-)

* 15:40 - [State of the Velociraptor][Q]

Blood bath!

* 16:40 - [Lightning Talks][R]

Havta catch'em all.

* 17:40 - [Closing][S]

At which point I expect my neurons to be overheated from all the
information soaking of the previous 72 hours.

## `around conference => sub &#123; ... }`

I'm supposed to land on Sunday, and take off on Thursday, somewhat later
during the day.  I already have a short list of folks to meet during the
events (hi Tommy!), and something tells me that this list is going to grow some more
before I board my plane. In that regard, if for whatever reason you'll be
there and want to meet, feel free to poke me. Or just play "hunt the Yenzie"
directly on site. :-)
