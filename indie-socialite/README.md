# On becoming an Indie Socialite

In April, I saw Brian Wisti's [tutorial on Indieweb h-cards](https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/) pop up, gave 
it a quick read, thought "hey, neat!", and filed it under *stuff to add 
to the Galuga* as time allows.

Then I kept seeing [his other Indieweb blog
entries](https://randomgeekery.org/tags/indieweb/) appear, and 
although the movement is still small and the tooling in its first stages,
it's something that feels like it should be right up my alley. Control
over my data? Publish things at a central location and let technomancy
propagrate it all over? Color me intrigued.

And then [The Perl Conference in the Cloud](https://perlconference.us/tpc-2020-cloud/) happened, and [Jason McIntosh](https://jmac.org/) introduced his
[Web::Mention](https://metacpan.org/pod/Web::Mention) module, as well as 
[whim](https://metacpan.org/pod/Whim), the multitool built on top of it.

A guy can only take so much before caving in....

So behold, as my author box is now a shiny little h-card. Well,
technically, it ain't shiny at all, as most of the markup is 
invisible to human readers. But anyway, it's there. 

Equaly invisible
is the `whim` service now running on good ol' Babyl. 

And, powered by it, is the new webmentions section that -- if there are any -- sits below blog
entries. Obviously, at the time of me writing this
there is no comment for this blog entry, but my [previous
entry](https://techblog.babyl.ca/entry/bertasker/) has a few comments, if you
want to see what it looks like).

Now, if you excuse me, I have to go and see 
if [brid.gy](https://brid.gy) can really auto-send tweets from
pages...
