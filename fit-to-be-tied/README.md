# Fit To Be tied (tied handles and localized $\)

This one was going to be a cry for help and a request to confirm that I'm not
going cuckoo, but I think I figured it out. Still, for giggles, hear this:

I was playing around with one of my favorite Himalayan barbershop (*Galuga*, one
of those projects that just generate endless yak shaving) when I noticed
something funny with tied filehandles. After much head-scratching, I was able
to corner the problem with this small example:


```perl
use 5.10.0;

use strict;
use warnings;

{
    package Foo;

    sub TIEHANDLE { return bless \my $i, shift; }

    sub PRINT { shift; $::X .= join '', @_, $\; } 

}

say "this is perl $]\n";

print '>>>';
print "nothing here-->";
say   "but a CR there->";
print "and nothing here->";
print '<<<';

tie *::FOO, 'Foo';

print "\n\n";
print FOO "nothing here-->";
say   FOO "but a CR there->";
print FOO "and nothing here->";
print '>>>', $::X, '<<<';

$\ = '';
$::X = '';

print "\n\n";
print FOO "nothing here-->";
say   FOO "but a CR there->";
print FOO "and nothing here->";
print '>>>', $::X, '<<<';
```

Basically, I define a package that will act like a filehandle. The `$\` used
in its `PRINT` is, according to [perltie](http://perldoc.perl.org/perltie.html), the magic way to make sure
`print` and `say` will both work: in the case of a `say`, `$\` will be
localized and assigned a carriage return.  Sounds good, no? But let's see what
happens when we run this baby:


```
$ perl fit_to_be_tied.pl 
this is perl 5.014002

>>>nothing here-->but a CR there->
and nothing here-><<<

Use of uninitialized value $\ in join or string at tie.pl line 13.
>>>nothing here-->but a CR there->
and nothing here->
<<<

>>>nothing here-->but a CR there->
and nothing here-><<<
```

The first stanza using *STDOUT* looks okay, but for the second stanza the
`print` after the `say` seems to cling to having `$\ = "\n"` even if it's not
supposed to. And to add a dash of *uh?* to the whole thing, if we set the
global '$\' not to be `undef` (as we do in the third stanza), all is fine
again.

Fortunately, and thanks to `perlbrew`, I have a perl 5.17.6 lying around, and
if I try the same test with it, I get:

```
$ perl fit_to_be_tied.pl 
this is perl 5.017006

>>>nothing here-->but a CR there->
and nothing here-><<<

Use of uninitialized value $\ in join or string at tie.pl line 13.
Use of uninitialized value $\ in join or string at tie.pl line 13.
>>>nothing here-->but a CR there->
and nothing here-><<<

>>>nothing here-->but a CR there->
and nothing here-><<<
```

Well, look at that. Everything's now behaving the way it should. I quickly
perused the perldeltas since 5.16.1 (where the issue can also be seen) but
didn't noticed any bug fix that could account for the change of behavior.
Well, even then I won't complain. I'll just have one more reason to way for
5.18.0 with bated breath...
