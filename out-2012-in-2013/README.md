# Reminiscences of 2012, Foreshadowings of 2013

It has come again. This magic time of the year when, in-between the
hangovers of Christmas and the hangovers of the New Year bashes, one takes a
longing look back at the ending year, and make mad plans, wistful wishes and 
grandiose resolutions for the new one. So, for a moment, let me indulge in
this tradition and let my gaze wander at the
distances that stretch forward and behind, while my mind drift back and forth betwixt what has been and what
shall be. But gently. 'Cause lemme tell you, that was damn good eggnog (so
please be kind and don't click so hard with the mouse, will you?).

## 2012 - The One Getting Out of Scope

### Faster, Tygercat! Blog! Blog!

I think I remember that one of my resolution of last year was to
keep the blogging furnace hot and running. Well, that I daresay happened.
Fourty blog entries have been churned in 2012 (fourty-one, if we count this
one), coming out with a satisfying regularity. Although a significant dip could be observed
in December. Because I was slacking? Well, not really. Rather because the Perl
advent calendars were in full swing, and that I ended up contributing both to
the [classic Perl 5](http://perladvent.org/) and the [Dancer](http://advent.perldancer.org/2012) calendars.
Counting those, my blog tally for 2012 goes up to 51. Almost, aaaaaalmost a
batting average of one per week.  Not to shabby. Not enough to get me to level
up from my Paperman status in the [Perl Ironman Challenge](http://www.enlightenedperl.org/ironman.html), mind you, 
but I begin to suspect that only Isaac Asimov could ever have been able to
keep up with that one.

### Stress-testing GitHub

Of course, all that blogging is fine and dandy, but it's only the soapbox on
top of the iceberg.  Blips on the radar indicating which projects were
touched, which CPAN modules came to be and got improved on.  As it is my
habit, I got fairly all over the place. Dist::Zilla plugins, smoke testing, 
web services, Hadoop integration, Dancer stuff, event-driven daemons,
database (both of the SQL and non-SQL variety) interfacing, and countless
wacky ideas that just had to be POC'ed. My own little pet projects, like
Galuga, Template::Caribou and XML::XSS didn't get all the love that they
deserve, but the work that went into them generate some non-trivial amount of yak
shaving (and by 'non-trivial', I mean measured in metric crap-tons) 
and CPAN patches that (or so I like to think) benefit the greater
community.

### YAPC::EU

2012 was also the year of my first YAPC::EU. It being in Frankfurt was just
too serenpendious to pass.  YAPCs are, for me, an occasion to get the pulse of
what's happening in the greater Perl world, but mostly to solidify the strands
of my social network.  And I'm always surprised, even considering how I'm not
the most outgoing person ever, and how YAPC only last three short days, of how
well that works. Beside the myriad of nods, greetings and quick chats, I was
able to hook with Martin Evans (aka, the guy you should thank for the lion
share of DBD::Oracle's work in the last year), Gabor and a significant subset
of the Dancer crew. 

### Dancer

Talking of Dancer... I already had contributed a few patches to the project
(both in its 1.0 and 2.0 incarnations), but those meat-space meetings at YAPC
caused things to escalate. Shortly after my return from Germany, I was
absorbed into the core Dancer crew and ever since, well, I try very hard not
to make those delightful guys not regret their decision. 


## 2013 - Namespace Just About to Autovivificate

So, what's in store for 2013? 

Well, it's safe to assume I won't shut up
anytime soon. I aim for a blog entry every 2 weeks as a minimum, but breaching
the one-a-week would be nice, just to keep the Perl Weekly well furnished.

... talking of which. My chats with Gabor at YAPC also bore fruits, and he's
in the process of recruiting me for an editorial dark alliance for the Perl
Weekly. For those who missed the good ol' [Shuck and Awe](http://www.pythian.com/news/category/perl/shuck-awe/) days, 
rejoice, for
I'll be back aggregating Perl news for your everlasting pleasure.

And then there is Dancer 2, which I'll make my foremost priority. The core is
pretty much ready for prime time, but there is still work to be done on all
plugins and template interfaces. Enough to keep me happy for some time, I
guess. And once we're done and Dancer 2 is out there... well, don't repeat it
to anybody else, but I entertain this quixotic notion of a Dancer 2 book. It's
not exactly like I have the time, nor like it's going to provides me with
endless riches, but... it's not like any of those things stopped me before.

Beside that, I see in my crystal ball more of the same that we saw in 2012.
More modules on CPAN, a few adoptions, a wheelbarrow-worth of mad schemes
being played with, maybe one or two actually working out. I kind of hope 
that I'll be able to make it to YAPC::NA, which will be in early June in
Austin, but we'll see. 

So, yeah, 2013. It's shaping up to be a fun year... See you there!
